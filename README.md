# Introduction 
This is a library for making calls with [ErplyAPI](https://learn-api.erply.com/) in C#. It was built with simplicity in mind and using it should need as little code as possible. 
E.g you construct main class with only one line `new Erply(123456, "User", "Password)"` and you can already make calls to Erply.
Calls and their corresponding models are added according to need, because there are too many to add at once. 
Current calls and models have been generated by a script and generated code is also included.
Because generated code isn't perfect, adding it to project can take some adjustment, e.g adding `[ErplyConverter(typeof(ListConverter))]` attributes, new classes and so on,
but should include all available calls and their properties.
